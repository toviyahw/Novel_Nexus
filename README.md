A collection of the many chapters I have read, over the course of the many different chapters of my life.

Potential entities: ratings table --> pacing, plot, prose, book table --> pages, title, author fname lname, isbn, genre, start date, end date, \
tags table (childhood favorite, best of the month, one of my favorites, on the brain)\
awards table (nominations, awards)\
Series table (books included in series, start and end date for series)\
format table (audio, digital, physical)\
authors table (name, genres)\
my librbary (titles I have physical copies of)

Why was this necessary, no platform provides ratings on what I really care about, this is custom made for me, and will help me understand my reading habits and behaviors, as well as serve as a display of how my reading habits and tastes evolve over time. Goodreads is garbage.
