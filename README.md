Why was this necessary, no platform provides ratings on what I really care about, this is custom made for me, and will help me understand my reading habits and behaviors, as well as serve as a display of how my reading habits and tastes evolve over time. Goodreads is garbage.\

rating books on a scale from 1-5 and writing a breif 

Whenever I tell someone I love to read books, the question that typically follows is "What's your favorite book?", and thats the part where I freeze and spiral. A question that haunts me relentlessly because the truth is, I could not even begin to answer that. There are too many favorites, for too many different reasons, that change too often. So- instead I wrote this SQL query that will tell me what my current "favorite" is, and I will have a quick and easy answer to that dreaded question that I could never conjure up an answer to on my own.

Stored procedure ideas: favorite ever, best of the month BOM, best of the year, average reading time, average pages read, totals for these, best in each genre, best series, total days read, best audio, physical, hardback, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY my 'favorite' book. total books read, and by each genre.
