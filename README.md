Why was this necessary, no platform provides ratings on what I really care about, this is custom made for me, and will help me understand my reading habits and behaviors, as well as serve as a display of how my reading habits and tastes evolve over time. Goodreads is garbage.\

rating books on a scale from 1-5 and writing a breif 

Whenever I tell someone I love to read books, the question that typically follows is "What's your favorite book?". A question that haunts me relentlessly because the truth is, I could not even begin to answer that. There are too many favorites, for too many different reasons, that change too often. So- instead I wrote this SQL query that will tell me what my current "favorite" is, and I will have a quick and easy answer to that dreaded question.
