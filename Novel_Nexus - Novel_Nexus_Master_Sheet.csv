The nerdy medical science-y terms and conditions felt well thought out and the twists- I guessed some of them, others were a pleasant surprise. The pacing in the beginning might seem slow to many, but something about it didn’t really make it difficult to get through to the second half where things start to pick up. A true dark and splendid slow burn with a neatly wrapped ending, loved it. "

7,,Sharp Objects,Gillian Flynn,9780307341556,254,paperback,yes,18,2007,,,,4.01,1,read,0,"WHALE, that was certainly…an experience. Let me start by saying the only reason this received 2 stars is because of the writing. I enjoyed that aspect. The pacing was a bit slow at times for me but nothing to put the book down over. I thought the repeated descriptions of her sister and the other young girls was unnecessary, after the first couple times I thought- ok we get it, she’s got nice boobs….<br/><br/>All of the characters need therapy, the plot twist just didn’t hit like I thought it would with all the ranting and raving about this book. I think the level of fucked up all the characters are actually made me sort of shrug a shoulder at the ending because…well yeah I wasn’t surprised. By that point I think it was clear just how troubled everyone was- especially the culprit- so it kind of just made sense? <br/><br/>Also, Alan??? He could’ve been left out completely and it wouldn’t have made much of a difference and for all the time I spent having to read about him- I would’ve preferred it that way. <br/><br/>Anyway- 2.5 for the writing, it was immersive and interesting enough for the most part- a bit tedious a times, this will be the first and last novel I read by Miss Flynn.<br/><br/>EDIT: F*ck that, 1 star. The writing is good sometimes but I just remembered all the “starship burns at my ankle” and “broken sings at my armpit” ugh."

10,,Behind Closed Doors,B.A. Paris,9781250122155,295,paperback,yes,19,2016,,,,3.98,5,read,0,"Splendiiiid read! Initially, I thought it may not be very exciting because it is reveled in the synopsis and early on in the book that the husband is a psychopath. Kinda felt like it may be a tedious read. As such, I did not expect Grace’s journey and telling of how she ended up here to be so gripping but alas, here I am- incredibly gripped.<br/><br/>Loved the writing, loved the pacing, loved the characters (psychopaths excluded of course), and LOVED LOVED LOVED the ending. <br/><br/>Is this book the most TECHNICALLY thrilling read? Mmm perhaps? Really nothing to outright traditionally “scary”, BUT there were plenty of these crazy tense moments that had me flying through the words, but can I say I was necessarily thrilled most of the time? No, but I had a better reading experience reading this than I had with more “thrilling” thrillers, so don’t let this dissuade you<br/><br/>HOWEVER, this is one of my most favorite reads of the year so far, it’s simply a damn good story. I was so invested in Grace and Millie and sopped up every interaction they had like a sheet of that expensive premium paper towel. <br/><br/>SIX STARS<br/><br/>Also. I quite enjoyed the whole George Clooney bit, and I was pleasantly surprised  that it had a true meaning."
11,"(Magnolia Parks Universe, #1)",Magnolia Parks,Jessa Hastings,9781737281191,423,digital,no,,2021,,,,3.71,2,read,0,"Well for starters I am exhausted. I feel as though a pack of wild horses has just finished trotting over my body. I get it, this is the very bad no good horrible start to a long and great and beloved series. I know this is book is pegged as a painful hurdle to jump so that readers can get into the nitty gritty awesomeness that is the remainder of the series. HOWEVER, I think this book could’ve been 200 pages shorter.<br/><br/> I feel like Jessa Hasting herself showed up to my house, entered my bedroom, and BEAT me over the head repeatedly with the “oh he fucked up- I’m angry at him- but I love him so I will keep playing games- oh now I fucked up- let me pull my doe eyed deer face look and have everyone fall in love with me and my obnoxiousness” moments. I am concussed. I get it- they are Chernobyl level toxic. About halfway through this book it felt like small variations of the same fuck-up were being shoveled down my throat and I am TIRED. It got predictable and boring. I was not very invested in any of the characters so hopefully that changes. I also was not huge a fan of the writing. I like the abundance of dialogue and blame parts were a bit toooo straight to the point and it felt incredibly jumbled at some points. Then again, my irritation with the writing seemed to grow alongside my irritation with the same plot points happening over and over again- so perhaps they are one and the same.<br/><br/>ANYHOOO. Will I continue the series? Yes. Do I hate this book? No, but only barely."

Forth Wing is super fast-paced and all around fun! This book may not be for everyone, but you have to admit this is great for people who may be in a reading slump or want to explore new genres, it’s just a fun and easy read. The pacing is spot on for me and I devoured this book in a day! It was so easy to immerse myself in this universe and the world building was easy to follow and much more manageable than the standard fantasy book. Great characters, great plot, I’m excited for the next 2 books :)"

I know people have their reservations and opinions about Colleen Hoover but I am glad I did not let stop me from reading this fantastic story. Put all that aside and trust that the outpouring of love for this book is genuine. When I finished the book I thought now THIS is a thriller, a romantic thriller, but a thriller nonetheless. As for the romance part- eh, I’m not entirely convinced of the connection the MMC and FMC had, especially so quickly, but I wasn’t really focused on that anyway- the storyline had me hooked. There was occasionally verbiage that made me cringe a little, or words from characters that seemed out of place and awkward- I didn’t care nearly enough to stop and the story is so damn good I don’t think I could if I tried. I laughed, I gasped, I had to take breaks to pace around my room to ponder and decompress- in short, I had a blast and I think most readers will too. <br/><br/>tldr: this romantic thriller is very thrilling! I highly recommend the read just make sure your schedule is clear for a few hours because once you pick it up, you’re not going to put it down."

I wasn’t expecting much, simple premise, simple thriller, I just wanted a fun read. This is the first book I’ve read by the author and I’m not sure I’ll be open to trying another: <br/><br/>1. 85-90% of this book is wattpad romance garbage. And I LIKE an occasional trashy romance but where was the THRILL???<br/>2. The ending was offensive. The coppiest of all cop-outs in my opinion. Just lazy. Its seems as though the author wasn’t sure WHAT the hell the book was about and then smashed a bunch of nonsense into the last 2 chapters and called it a twist. <br/>3. Sheriff Almond. Yes…Almond. I laughed at first in disbelief but then I was mad.<br/>4. The characters are not that memorable or loveable in any way. In the end the twist was even less twisty because at that point I just DID NOT care and was sick of the back and forth “omg he’s so hot and sweet I need him” to “hmm that’s a bit odd I should get the hell up outta here”.<br/><br/>Anyway. Would I recommend? No. This book is like a spoiled casserole of nonsense, Tom foolery, and dissapointment"
